# vis-survey
PHP Survey Tool

The (PHP) Framework in this repository is a supplement to our paper, ***Faceted Views of Varying Emphasis (FaVVEs): a framework for visualising multi-perspective small multiples***, to be published at [EUROVIS 2016](http://www.cs.rug.nl/jbi/eurovis2016/)

The code included in the framework is a simple system for running a user study. This repo includes all files necessary, including the sql files to create the database, which will hold the results of the study. Due to the disk space limitations of github, we had to store the [visualizations on google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6xEIVHoxTYZcVVjYm1fSzRWT3M/view?usp=sharing). If you just want to use the system to run your own user study, no need to download them.
