The code included in the framework is simple system to run a user study. This repo includes all files necessary, including the sql files to create the database, which will hold the results of the study. Due to the disk space limitations of github, we had to store the [visualizations on google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6xEIVHoxTYZcVVjYm1fSzRWT3M/view?usp=sharing). If you just want to use the system to run your own user study, no need to download them.
