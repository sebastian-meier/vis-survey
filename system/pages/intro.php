<strong>Title of study: Evaluating techniques for multi-perspective comparison across small multiples</strong><br /> 
We would like to invite you to take part in this research study. Below are some details about the study and what it would involve from you. Do contact us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.<br />
<br />
<!-- 
<strong>What is the study about?</strong><br />
The study aims to understand the perceptive qualities of a visualization technique. <br />
 <br />
<strong>What will happen during the study?</strong><br />
The study will last for 45 minutes. You will receive a short introduction and training, afterwards you will be asked to solve a series of tasks. After solving the tasks you will be asked to complete a short survey with a few additional questions.<br />
<br />
 -->
<strong>Why have I been invited?</strong><br />
We have chosen participants who have some knowledge in data visualization and data analytics.<br />
<br />
<strong>Do I have to take part? </strong><br />
Participation is voluntary, and you can choose not to participate in part or all of the project. You can withdraw at any stage. <br />

<br />
<strong>What will happen if I take part? </strong><br />
<ul>
<li>The test will take about 45 minutes</li>
<li>Apart from this study there will be no follow-up studies or questionnaires that you will be asked to complete</li>
<li>There will be a short introduction and training, then a computer based test and a questionnaire</li>
<li>It is a simple quantitative and qualitative user study to determine the performance of a novel visualization technique</li>
<!--<li>The test will take place in the seminar room</li>
<li>We will offer a complimentary sandwich for the participants of the study</li>-->
</ul>

<strong>What do I have to do? </strong><br />
As part of the questionnaire you will be asked to study several images and perform some visual pattern matching and recognition tasks.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? </strong><br />
None.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</strong><br />
Your responses will help to contribute findings to a novel research study that will be published in a leading journal.  Your experience of the user study may give some insight into how empirical research is conducted in Computer Science.<br />
<br />
<strong>What will happen when the research study stops? </strong><br />
On completion of the research project, the data will be held by the researchers conducting the experiment. It will not be stored on cloud drives or shared network drives. It will reside on external hard drives only accessible to the researchers working on this study.<br />
<br />
<strong>Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential? </strong><br />
All collected data will be anonymised, non-anonymised data will be deleted after anonymization.<br />
The anonymised data will not be shared with third parties or anyone beyond the research group and their supervising researchers.<br />
Quantitative and Qualitative insights gathered from the anonymised data will be published in academic publications. Those insights won’t allow anyone to depict individual participants.<br />
<br />
<strong>What will happen to results of the research study?</strong><br />
As stated above, results gathered from the study will be used for academic publications and research reports. The latter are not public, but the publications will be added to City University London’s open access repository. If you would like to be informed about any future publications, please get in touch with us and we will send you a link as soon as the work is published. Contact information is attached at the end of the document.<br />
<br />
<strong>What will happen if I don’t want to carry on with the study? </strong><br />
You are free to withdraw from the study without an explanation or penalty at any time.<br />
